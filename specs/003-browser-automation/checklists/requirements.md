# Specification Quality Checklist: Browser Automation Provider Path

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-07-10
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- The spec references "agent-browser" as a provider reference in the Assumptions section, which is acceptable since it describes the reference project, not an implementation decision.
- The spec aligns with the existing adoption-stages.md Stage 3 scope and the shared board item T-012.
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed; all ambiguities were resolved with reasonable defaults documented in the Assumptions section.
